To run the app you need to first have two vscode windows open

(It helps if you have two monitors haha)

First, open Final in both vscode instances. Then cd one into backend, and one into finalproject

Now, in the terminal that is cd to backend do "nodemon backend.js" (make sure you have nodemon installed ofc)

Then once that successfully starts, go to your other terminal that is cd to finalproject, and do npm start

Should work as long as you have the necessary stuff installed!
